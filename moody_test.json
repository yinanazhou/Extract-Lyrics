A place inside my brain Another kind of pain You don't know the chances I'm so blind Blind Blind  Another place I find To escape the pain inside You don't know the chances What if I should die? A place inside my brain Another kind of pain You don't know the chances I'm so blind Blind Blind  [Bridge: Jonathan Davis] Deeper, and deeper, and deeper As I journey to live a life that seems to be A lost reality That can never find a way to reach my inner... Self-esteem is low How deep can I go In the ground that I lay If I don't find a way to See through the gray that clouds my mind This time I look to see what's between the lines  I can see, I can see I'm going blind I can see, I can see I'm going blind I can see, I can see I'm going blind I can see, I can see I'm going blind  [Chorus: Jonathan Davis & Head] I can see, I can see I'm going blind I can see, I can see I'm going blind I can see, I can see I'm going blind I can see, I can see I'm going blind I can see, I can see I'm going blind (I can see I'm going) I can see, I can see I'm going blind (going blind) I can see, I can see I'm going blind I can see, I can see I'm going blind!
